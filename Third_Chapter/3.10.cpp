// Write a program that takes an operation followed by two operands and outputs the result. For example:
// + 1003.14* 45

// Read the operation into a string called operation and use an if-statement to figure out which operation the user wants,
// for example, if (operation=="+"). Read the operands into variables of type double.
// Implement this for operations called +, â€“, *, /, plus, minus, mul, and div with their obvious meanings.
