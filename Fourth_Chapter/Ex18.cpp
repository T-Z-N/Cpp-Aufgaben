//Todo Write a program to solve quadratic equations. A quadratic equation is of the form
// ax2 + bx + c = 0
// If you donâ€™t know the quadratic formula for solving such an expression, do some research.
// Remember, researching how to solve a problem is often necessary before a programmer can
// each the computer how to solve it. Use doubles for the user inputs for a, b, and c.
// Since there are two solutions to a quadratic equation, output both x1 and x2
